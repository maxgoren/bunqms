Bottom Up Natural Queue Merge Sort.

Due to the interest garnered on reddit, I decided to create

a change would be hassle.

A full explaination of the algorithm and the thought process behind
it can be found at http://www.maxgcoding.com/queue-mergesort-a-comparison-optimal-bottom-up-sort-for-linked-lists/
